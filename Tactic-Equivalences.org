#+TITLE: Equivalences between tactics in HOL4 and Coq

Some approximate equivalences between HOL4 and Coq tactics.
Note that some may not be true equivalences but they can just be used in similar ways.

| Coq        | HOL4                                  |
|------------+---------------------------------------|
| apply      | drule, irule, match_mp_tac            |
| subst      | rveq (from CakeML preamble)           |
| specialize | qspecl_then                           |
| eexists    | asm_exists_tac (from CakeML preamble) |
| rewrite    | once_rewrite_tac, rewrite_tactic, ... |
| simpl in * | fs[]                                  |
